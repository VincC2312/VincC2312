  I'm a Junior Web Developer focusing to learn and improve myself more every single day consistently.
  I love Frontend Developement due to I like building stuff and designing things. 
  I know that this is not an easy journey that's why it makes me more excited and embracing myself to go even further to improve myself.:relaxed:
